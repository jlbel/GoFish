# GoFish
GoFish is a popular card game that is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The game can be played with 2 to 6 players. Each player is dealt a hand of cards, and the objective of the game is to collect as many sets of four cards as possible.

To begin the game, each player is dealt 7 cards face down. The remaining cards are placed in a deck in the middle of the table. The player to the left of the dealer goes first. The player asks any opponent for a specific rank of card. For example, they might say “Do you have any 6’s?” If the opponent has the requested card, they hand it over to the player who asked for it.

If the opponent does not have the requested card, the player who asked must “go fish” by drawing a card from the deck. If the player draws the card they asked for, they can continue their turn by asking for another card. If the player does not get the requested card, then their turn ends, and it becomes the next player’s turn.

When a player forms a set of four cards of the same rank, that player places the set face up on the table in front of them. The game continues until all the cards have been collected into sets. The player with the most sets at the end of the game is the winner.
